# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Nice job managing your time and planning process to meet an achievable scope for the first project. Great readme! Sharing your process and thoughts is great. Would've liked to see your original sketches, ideas for how the game would look. As we move forward for larger projects, it would be nice to have more thoughts from your planning process, such as a Trello board, and relevant wireframes.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations, your project shows prolific use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! You clearly identified the problem and came up with a functional game in 85 lines of code, pretty sweet! I really like your creativity with the design, and overall layout!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice and clean! Html is clearly structured and validated, CSS looks good, and JS is not overly complex (in the best way)! Moving forward, try to think about ways to make your code more modular, and provide effective wrappers for your data. Would recommend using an object-oriented approach in the future.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations** Excellent work on this project! It looks like you had fun with this one, and made it your own. I would really like to see you implement the wish-list features outlined in your readme.

Keep it up. You'll be hired in no time.
