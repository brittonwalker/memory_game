Project One.

//Concentration//

Explanations Technologies Used:

This project was built using HTML, CSS, CSS Sprite Sheet, Javascript, JQuery, and Adobe Illustrator .

- HTML was used to set the structure of the document.
- CSS used for creating styling.
- Javascript/JQuery were you in conjunction to make game logic and manipulate the DOM.
- CSS Sprite Sheet used as a tool to decrease number of http requests for images.
- All images used were designed in Illustrator.

Approach Taken:

My approach began with consideration of how the game would be played and what elements I wanted to manipulate before I dug deeper into the logic. The process started with creating a set of user stories which are included at the end of this document. Next, sketch an idea and map the layout using HTML/CSS using divs for the cards manipulating classes and comparing the style attributes for logical results. From there, I used pseudo coding techniques to understand all the obvious components it would take to make this particular game work. MVP was meeting all of the user stories.

Unsolved Problems:

I met my MVP goal for this project. Unsolved problems are additional features I would have liked to implement for a better user experience and tracking statistics; timer, scoreboard, number of clicks, responsiveness, etc. The deadline came to a head as I met my original goals.

//////////////////

// 6 User Stories //

1. As a user, I should clearly be able to view and understand the rules, so I can know how the game is played.

2. As a user, I should be able to click every card to reveal its content, so I can play the game.

3. As a user, I should be notified if I make a match, so I can see what cards are left on the board.

4. As a user, I should know when I have won, so I can know that I have completed the game.

5. As a user, I should have the option to play again after the game is won, so I can have the board cleared and play again.

6. As a user, I should have a randomized board each game, so the game stays fresh.
